Players can challenge an artificial intelligence in a classic battle of naval strategy.

- Designed a graphical user interface with JavaFX that supports basic gaming functionalities like text display, difficulty selection, instructions page, sound effects, background music, and saving and loading gaming features
- Boosted the AIâ€™s winning rate against human users to about 60% by applying the concept of a probability density function


## File Descriptions
- src\java\main_files contains all java files utilized the OOP framework which establish aa comprehensive class hierarchy for integrating both coding logic and game interface development components
- src\java\resources contains all images, .fxml and css files for GUI
- target folder saved the pre-compiled java files in .class format


## Usage
It would be a bit difficult to setup the game in local machine as I used the IntelliJ build-in module environment setup to install javaFX model and setting src\java\main_files\Battleship.java as main file. One could see the sample playing video by downloading .mov in **Gaming** Folder
